        Evaluate options for using a cached memoryFS or streaming object instead 
        of an OSFS(tmp). This could offer significant performance improvements. 
        Writing to the cache is less of a problem since this would be done in 
        any case, though performance could be improved by writing to an 
        in-memory filesystem and then writing to both cache and auth.
