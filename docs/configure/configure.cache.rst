Caching Files Locally
=====================

One of the primary motivations for DataFS is the ability to have access to large numbers of versioned file systems in a distributed, heterogenous computing environment. This is achieved through explicit caching.

Caching in datafs is highly configurable, and is specific to each DataAPI instance, so you can have one profile which caches all archives locally and another with accesses files only through remote connections. This behavior is controlled through the use of API-specific cache policies.
