DataFS Data Management System
=============================

DataFS provides an abstraction layer for data storage systems. You can combine versioning, metadata management, team permissions and logging, and file storage all in a simple, intuitive interface.

Our goal is to make reading and writing large numbers of files in a team in a distributed, performance-critical computing environment feel as easy and intuitive as working with a handful of files on a local machine.
